Description: This script of the viral proteomics workflow (vPro-MS) enables identification of human-pathogenic viruses from patient samples by untargeted proteomics. vPro-MS is based on an in-silico derived peptide library covering the human virome in UniProtKB. The script is intended to identify human-pathogenic viruses from DiaNN outputs of either DIA or diaPASEF data. A scoring algorithm (vProID) assesses the confidence of virus identification and the results are finally summarized in a report table..
